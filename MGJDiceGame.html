					<center><h1>Chapter 1:Cold Body</h1></center>
					<p>
						You wake up to a very loud bang and realize instantly that something doesn’t feel right. You hear loud screaming on the outside of your apartment door and then an awkward silence, you sit there waiting for what’s to come next and almost jump out of your bed at the  sound of a loud bang on the door. Followed by another bang and then another.
						You ask “whos there?!” and seize in fear as you wait for a response. Bang after bang you know you can’t just sit there and do nothing.
						This next move and every move after could mean life or death so you take a deep breath and make your next move:

					<center><h1>Chapter 2:Apartment Departure</h1></center>
					<p>
						After killing the maniac trying to bite your face off you decide staying in your apartment probably isn’t the safest thing to do so you go back and grab everything you left.
						Very quietly you creep down the quiet hallway hearing a terrifying grunt here and there. You make it to the end of the hallway and notice the elevator is still working, but it also means making unnecessary noise when you can take the staircase next to it yet if you take the elevator you go from the 116th floor straight to the 1st floor in one shot.

					<p>
						Your on the first floor and you see blood and bodies everywhere, and a huge whole in the front entrance. Guess thats what woke you up? You start to walk through all the bodies and notice the signs posted everywhere. “If you are clean you are welcome to sanctuary! If you have been bitten please do not come you will be shot upon positive test results!” you notice the sanctuary is not far from your apartment complex. Yet due to certain circumstances an hour walk on a normal day may be a days worth now. You have two streets that you can take straight to sanctuary from your current position. Levi street which is lined with business that may help with cover but also may have hundreds of cold bodies waiting for some warm flesh.
						On the other hand there’s Hendrix ave which is lined with farmers markets and huge fields which might be a better idea but who knows.

					<p>
						you decide to take levi and realize it may not have been such a great idea. Halfway through you look back and notice your return is now blocked by hundreds of cold bodies that have caught your scent and are now on your trail. No going back and now you have to move even faster. As you approach the end of the street you see two oddly oversized cold bodies watching your every move as if to be studying you. You stand there frozen and debate on your next move and one of them begins to move their mouth as trying to speak. No he’s definitely speaking. Unknown words though. Maybe just jibberish. Shit! They begin to charge at you and now you have to make a decision on what to do next!

					<center><h1>Chapter 4B:THE BEAST</h1></center>
					<p>
						You start to walk down Hendrix with the positive attitude that it would be abandoned. You realize there is not a cold body in sight. Walking down the avenue you start to notice it might be a little too quiet. As you continue to sanctuary you hear a growling sound come from behind the stables of old man Jenkins. You figure its a better idea to ignore it and keep on your journey as its probably just a dog who is mad at his tail…...yeah that’s it. You start to hear the growling behind you and begin to speed walk. Now you can hear a  hoove noise with the growl. Your curiosity gets the best of you and you turn around to get a better understanding it. What you lay your eyes on makes you second guess suicide. Its as if a horse, zombie and a wolf had a baby. It looked like a horse but its stance was more like an angry, attack ready wolf with skin like a zombie. Your fight or flight kicks in and you guessed it. More decision making.
